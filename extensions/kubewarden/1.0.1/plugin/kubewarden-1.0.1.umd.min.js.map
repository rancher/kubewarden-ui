The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?

Each state can be handled\n * in one of two schemes: a tokenType map, or a subHandler.\n *\n * Standard expression elements are handled through the tokenType object. This\n * is an object map of all legal token types to encounter in this state (and\n * any unexpected token types will generate a thrown error) to an options\n * object that defines how they're handled.  The available options are:\n *\n *      {string} toState: The name of the state to which to transition\n *          immediately after handling this token\n *      {string} handler: The handler function to call when this token type is\n *          encountered in this state.  If omitted, the default handler\n *          matching the token's \"type\" property will be called. If the handler\n *          function does not exist, no call will be made and no error will be\n *          generated.  This is useful for tokens whose sole purpose is to\n *          transition to other states.\n *\n * States that consume a subexpression should define a subHandler, the\n * function to be called with an expression tree argument when the\n * subexpression is complete. Completeness is determined through the\n * endStates object, which maps tokens on which an expression should end to the\n * state to which to transition once the subHandler function has been called.\n *\n * Additionally, any state in which it is legal to mark the AST as completed\n * should have a 'completable' property set to boolean true.  Attempting to\n * call {@link Parser#complete} in any state without this property will result\n * in a thrown Error.\n *\n * @type {{}}\n */\nexports.states = {\n  expectOperand: {\n    tokenTypes: {\n      literal: { toState: 'expectBinOp' },\n      identifier: { toState: 'identifier' },\n      unaryOp: {},\n      openParen: { toState: 'subExpression' },\n      openCurl: { toState: 'expectObjKey', handler: h.objStart },\n      dot: { toState: 'traverse' },\n      openBracket: { toState: 'arrayVal', handler: h.arrayStart }\n    }\n  },\n  expectBinOp: {\n    tokenTypes: {\n      binaryOp: { toState: 'expectOperand' },\n      pipe: { toState: 'expectTransform' },\n      dot: { toState: 'traverse' },\n      question: { toState: 'ternaryMid', handler: h.ternaryStart }\n    },\n    completable: true\n  },\n  expectTransform: {\n    tokenTypes: {\n      identifier: { toState: 'postTransform', handler: h.transform }\n    }\n  },\n  expectObjKey: {\n    tokenTypes: {\n      identifier: { toState: 'expectKeyValSep', handler: h.objKey },\n      closeCurl: { toState: 'expectBinOp' }\n    }\n  },\n  expectKeyValSep: {\n    tokenTypes: {\n      colon: { toState: 'objVal' }\n    }\n  },\n  postTransform: {\n    tokenTypes: {\n      openParen: { toState: 'argVal' },\n      binaryOp: { toState: 'expectOperand' },\n      dot: { toState: 'traverse' },\n      openBracket: { toState: 'filter' },\n      pipe: { toState: 'expectTransform' }\n    },\n    completable: true\n  },\n  postTransformArgs: {\n    tokenTypes: {\n      binaryOp: { toState: 'expectOperand' },\n      dot: { toState: 'traverse' },\n      openBracket: { toState: 'filter' },\n      pipe: { toState: 'expectTransform' }\n    },\n    completable: true\n  },\n  identifier: {\n    tokenTypes: {\n      binaryOp: { toState: 'expectOperand' },\n      dot: { toState: 'traverse' },\n      openBracket: { toState: 'filter' },\n      pipe: { toState: 'expectTransform' },\n      question: { toState: 'ternaryMid', handler: h.ternaryStart }\n    },\n    completable: true\n  },\n  traverse: {\n    tokenTypes: {\n      identifier: { toState: 'identifier' }\n    }\n  },\n  filter: {\n    subHandler: h.filter,\n    endStates: {\n      closeBracket: 'identifier'\n    }\n  },\n  subExpression: {\n    subHandler: h.subExpression,\n    endStates: {\n      closeParen: 'expectBinOp'\n    }\n  },\n  argVal: {\n    subHandler: h.argVal,\n    endStates: {\n      comma: 'argVal',\n      closeParen: 'postTransformArgs'\n    }\n  },\n  objVal: {\n    subHandler: h.objVal,\n    endStates: {\n      comma: 'expectObjKey',\n      closeCurl: 'expectBinOp'\n    }\n  },\n  arrayVal: {\n    subHandler: h.arrayVal,\n    endStates: {\n      comma: 'arrayVal',\n      closeBracket: 'expectBinOp'\n    }\n  },\n  ternaryMid: {\n    subHandler: h.ternaryMid,\n    endStates: {\n      colon: 'ternaryEnd'\n    }\n  },\n  ternaryEnd: {\n    subHandler: h.ternaryEnd,\n    completable: true\n  }\n}\n","var root = require('./_root');\n\n/** Built-in value references. */\nvar Uint8Array = root.Uint8Array;\n\nmodule.exports = Uint8Array;\n","export const platform = ( typeof window === 'undefined' ?
