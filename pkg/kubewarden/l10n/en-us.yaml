    blurb: A Dynamic Admission Controller for Kubernetes
    description: |
      Kubewarden is a policy engine for Kubernetes. It helps with keeping your Kubernetes clusters secure and compliant. Kubewarden policies can be written using regular programming languages or Domain Specific Languages (DSL). Policies are compiled into WebAssembly modules that are then distributed using traditional container registries.

        Kubewarden administrators need to thoroughly examine the types of resources that a policy will access in order to prevent any misuse or abuse of the system. In some cases, it may be necessary to increase the permissions of the ServiceAccount associated with the PolicyServer to enable the policy to retrieve the required information. Although policies are restricted to read-only access to Kubernetes resources, there is a risk that a malicious attacker could exploit a Kubewarden policy to extract sensitive data from the cluster.
